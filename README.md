# :spider_web: github-java-api
An old java library for the GitHub API.
The emphasis here is on the fact that it is old.

Originally developed back in 2017, this library served its purpose.
Right now, it is just completely out of date.

## :warning: We do not recommend to use this library anymore.
This library will no longer be updated or maintained, it is full of bad practices, bad design patterns and the code is really bad.
We recommend to check out other libraries for this which are up to date and cleaner than this mess.

This was originally written for the GitHub v3 Rest API but we recommend you to switch to the usage of GitHub's newer v4 GraphQL API instead:<br>
https://docs.github.com/en/graphql

Anyway, the repository is still available in an archived and read-only version.
But you are definitely better off not to use this.
